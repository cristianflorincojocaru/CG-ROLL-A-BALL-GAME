A QA engineer, a software developer, and a sysadmin walk into a bar.

The QA engineer orders a beer.
The developer orders a beer.
The sysadmin orders a beer.

The QA engineer then orders -1 beers, 999999 beers, a lizard, and "NULL" beers, just to see what happens.

The developer panics and runs out of the bar.

Meanwhile, the sysadmin locks down the bar, installs security updates, and refuses to let anyone else in until next Monday.
